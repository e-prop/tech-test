## E-Prop Tech test

Consume this endpoint https://swapi.dev/api/people/ (full docs available at: https://swapi.dev/) and traverse the data, storing as you go. Display the data in a CRUD and allow to overwrite the stored data. The aim of this is not to get you to waste your life, timebox yourself to 1 hour and see where you get to, focus on the areas where you excel ready to discuss more fully in the next stage interview.

 

### What We Would Like to see
* Recursively traversing data and storing appropriately

* Laravel Migrations

* Caching where appropriate

* Validation

* Authorization 

* Tests where appropriate

* Responsive styling (Tailwind preferred https://tailwindcss.com/)
